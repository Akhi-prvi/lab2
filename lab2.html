 <div id="section1"> <p><b> Paris Olympics 2024 opening ceremony Highlights:</b> The floating parade in the <i> Paris Olympics </i> has begun, with iconic performances from pop icon Lady Gaga, metal band Gojiu, and Aya Nakamura thrilling the fans on either side of the Seine river. This is the first time when the athletes sail through a river to enter the Olympics in the summer event's history, with the Indian contingent being led by PV Sindhu and Sharath Kamal.
French President Emmanuel Macron has assured attendees that the event will be one of the most memorable opening ceremonies ever witnessed. The ceremony will be a vibrant celebration, reflecting Franceâ€™s ambitious vision for the Games and showcasing its unique cultural flair. The lineup of performers remains a secret, but speculation points to major stars such as US pop sensation Lady Gaga and French-Malian artist Aya Nakamura, the most listened-to French-speaking musician worldwide.

However, this bold approach comes with its own risks. France remains on high alert for potential terrorism threats, as the decision to host the ceremony along the Seine has prompted concerns about security and safety. On Friday, France's rail network SNCF was hit with widespread acts of vandalism, including arson attacks. Many trains to and from Paris have since been either cancelled or diverted.

As the opening ceremony marks the first time a Summer Olympics will commence outside the stadium, it will be protected by an extraordinary array of security measures. Nearly 45,000 police and paramilitary officers will be deployed, supported by an additional 10,000 soldiers and 20,000 private security personnel.

The comprehensive security strategy includes the use of AI-enhanced cameras and vigilant monitoring from rooftops, ensuring meticulous oversight of the event. Starting an hour before the event begins at 7:30 PM local time (11 PM IST), a no-fly zone with a radius of 150 km around Paris will be enforced. This restriction will affect one of Europe's busiest air traffic hubs, grounding or diverting all flights in the area to prevent aerial threats.Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

Why do we use it?
It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).


Where does it come from?
Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.

The standard chunk of Lorem Ipsum used since the 1500s is reproduced below for those interested. Sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 from "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" by Cicero are also reproduced in their exact original form, accompanied by English versions from the 1914 translation by H. Rackham.

Where can I get some?
There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available, but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable. If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text. All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet. It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected humour, or non-characteristic words etc.



Two-time Olympic medallist shuttler PV Sindhu and five-time Olympian Sharath Kamal were India's flag-bearers at the marquee opening ceremony, leading the 117-athlete strong contingent for the Games. However, India did kickstart the Olympics campaign a day before the opening ceremony with archery ranking rounds, where both men's and women's teams qualified for the quarter-finals.some main sports items are,
